		<p>I am studying Computer Science, I play the steel pan with UWI Panoridim Steel Orchestra, and I play tennis from time to time.
			I'm interested in Web Development because I like to see the way how things come alive such as being able to go to a website and imagine the various
			code that was used to create it.
